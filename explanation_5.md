This is most enjoyfull problem that i solved. It is been a really pleasure for me to understand how autocomplete works
1. Time complexity analysis of Autocomplete suffixes find is
   - O(nlogn) 
2. Space complexity analysis of Autocomplete suffixes find is
    A(logn). Because space is hold list items more than once since there is recursion
