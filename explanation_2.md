1. Time complexity analysis of rotated_array_search is
   - O(logn) due to divide and conquer algorithm. This algorithm first find pivot and find the search item in the divided array
2. Space complexity analysis of rotated_array_search is
    A(logn). Because space is used in recuresively for holding divided list items
