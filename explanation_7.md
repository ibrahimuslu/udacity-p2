This is also very helpful problem for me to understand how a router works efficiently
1. Time complexity analysis of Router is
   - Insert a handler
    O(n) and in single traverse
   - Find a route 
    O(n) and in single traverse
2. Space complexity analysis of Router is
    - Inserting handler in one single traverse no recursion A(1) is the space complexity
    - Finding route is also in single traverse and no recursion so A(1) is the space complexity for this
