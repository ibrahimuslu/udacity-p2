This is also very helpful problem for me to understand how a router works efficiently
1. Time complexity analysis of Router is
   - Insert a handler
    O(n) and in single traverse
   - Find a route 
    O(n) and in single traverse
2. Space complexity analysis of get_min_max is
    A(1). Because space is used only hold list items once and there is no recursion or else
